# Final Project - Ying Tao(ID:22019022)
## Pink Sky and Tree-Introduction
This project aims to use web3d technology to create a dreamy sky that does not exist in reality. Whether it is the flying balls or the trees that appear in the sky, they are all things that do not exist in the sky. And the color of the sky is also different from reality. Although these imaginary scenes do not appear in real life, in the computer, we can realize the imagined scenes through code.

This project is mainly divided into two parts: 3D picture and background audio. The 3d screen part is a web3D project based on three.js. The project mainly uses three.js built-in scenes, cameras, 3d objects, lights, materials, etc. to build 3d images on web pages, and combines the model files created by Blender to present the models on web pages using three.js. The background audio is mainly processed and synthesized by MaxiInstuments.js in the basic mimic platform.

## Require
Three.js and MaxiInstuments.js are required to run the project. 
MaxiInstuments.js is provided by mimic development platform. https://mimicproject.com/about
