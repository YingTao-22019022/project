# Final Project - Ying Tao(ID:22019022)
## Pink Sky and Tree-Introduction
The main inspiration for the project was Taylor Swift's 2019 album lover cover. The pink sky is not something you see in real life. But the pink sky does represent the mood of people in love. Love is like a tree living in the pink sky. No matter in spring, summer, autumn and winter, even in the coldest season, when all the leaves on the tree fall off, lovers will surround the tree. At the same time, they are always surrounded by love. This is perhaps the most intuitive and vulgar expression of love. But I love this expression.
When facing materials, we usually use metal materials and wood materials to distinguish materials with different properties. At the same time, the objects from which these materials originate are naturally linked to these materials. Trees and metals are as they should be for as long as anyone can remember. But in the computer world, we can ignore these rules, we can use wood to represent a flower, we can use metal to render a tree. That's the beauty of computers.
In China, computer characters are called paper people, because we always think that the screen is flat. There is often something in it that feels unreal to people. We usually see realistic 3D objects in large-scale computer games or games, or special effects movies. But they are all very bloated and don't appear in our daily life. The browser is something that people will encounter in their daily life. Presenting lightweight and realistic 3D visual effects in the browser is a matter of bringing the distance between people and computers closer.
This project aims to use web3d technology to create a dreamy sky that does not exist in reality. Whether it is the flying balls or the trees that appear in the sky, they are all things that do not exist in the sky. And the color of the sky is also different from reality. Although these imaginary scenes do not appear in real life, in the computer, we can realize the imagined scenes through code.
This project is mainly divided into two parts: 3D picture and background audio. The 3d screen part is a web3D project based on three.js. The project mainly uses three.js built-in scenes, cameras, 3d objects, lights, materials, etc. to build 3d images on web pages, and combines the model files created by Blender to present the models on web pages using three.js. The background audio is mainly processed and synthesized by MaxiInstuments.js in the basic mimic platform.
